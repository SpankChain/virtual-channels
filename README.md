# virtual-channels
This repo contains contract code related to Connext and Spankchain's payment channel hub implementation. 

How to use these docs: 
- An in-depth walkthrough of the spec (with diagrams) can be found in the `spec.MD` file. If you don't understand how our framework works, we reccommend starting there.
- Test cases are outlined in `./tests`
- This readme contains an explanation of all of the contract functions along with code/state samples.
